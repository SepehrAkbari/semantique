## Notebook

This notebook is written to provide a clear and simple walkthrough of the code and approach taken to make this model. 

All the code used in the notebook was ran on a Cluster with GPUs, and is not intended to be run on a Jupyter notebook. To run the code locally, we suggest using the [scripts](../scripts/) folder instead, and running `training.py` directly. You can use `predict.py` to run inference on the model without the frontend application.
